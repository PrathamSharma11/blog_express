         <p>There are many ways that people get news today -- on the radio, through magazine subscriptions, or even on social media. There are various types of news distribution too, but one of the most popular ways that people get their news is through online news outlets.

          It's super easy to Google any current events or stories that are happening for the day and find online media to read about the topic. It's gotten easier and easier to get the latest information online because most people have their phones on them at all times. A news blog is a fast way for people to stay on top of current events. News blogs tend to be updated more frequently than more traditional methods of getting the news like television or radio.</p>
